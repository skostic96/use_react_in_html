# Use ReactJS locally

I download ReactJS code manually and add it to the two files `react-dom@18/react-dom.development.js` and `react@18/react.development.js`, which I reference using `script` tags and therefore I am able to use the React with vanilla JavaScript.

# Setup

Download [Content Delivery Network - react-dom.development.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js) to [Local file - react-dom.development.js](./react-dom%4018/react-dom.development.js)

Download [Content Delivery Network - react.development.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js) to [Local file - react.development.js](./react%4018/react.development.js)
